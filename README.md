## Use Cases

Unregistered User Scenario: For users who have not registered, GamerOracle utilizes its comprehensive database to generate game suggestions. This is achieved by:
- Analyzing ratings obtained from APIs and user feedback to suggest top-rated games.
- Examining the user's input of a particular game and suggesting similar games based on rating and resemblance.

Registered User Scenario: For registered users, GamerOracle takes a similar approach but with an added layer of personalization.
- More emphasis is placed on the user's submitted reviews of games on our platform. This results in a more tailored experience, where recommendations are specifically designed to match the user's gaming preferences and history.
